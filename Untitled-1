1. key value pairs passed under the params section of postman will be treated as the query parameters, we can get 
that using "req.query" keyword.

2. we can pass the data with "GET" request as well but as this is not the good practice so we want to send the data
using the "GET" request then we can pass it throigh the "params" and we can get that using "req.query" keyword.

3. We are using "router" instead of "app" because it has one advantage that we can add prefix for router only

4. dotenv package is used to use the env variable

5. If we want to login just after the register then we need to setup the cookie in the register function itself

6. If for a particular field we wrote "select: false" in its schema then it means it will not fetch the data
  of that field in whole object automatically instead we need to fetch it manually

7. cookieParser is used to access the cookie

8. Always use try catch block while using async await 

9 Backend runs on different url and frontend runs on different url so to make it compaible we have to use the middleware
named as "Cors" by passing the appropriate headers
